    ### 2. Test process
#### 2.1. Test planning

The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the PIM module from the OrangeHRM application.

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan.

**Entry criteria:**
- Business specifications are defined 
- Roles needed for the project are allocated 
- Initial project risks were detected and mitigated 

**Exit criteria:**
- All test cases have been executed 
- The unresolved bugs/defects have low priority 
- No detected major risks remained un-mitigated 
- All resolved bugs have been retested and approved by the testers
- Regression testing have been ran and no major bugs detected  
- All business requirements have been covered by test cases 
- All business requirements have been met 

**Risks:**
- Product risks: Validation constraints on the fields might be too restrictive to the end user 

#### 2.2 Test analysis 
- Analyze the business requirements to make sure that we have all the details to create the test conditions 
- Write test conditions that will be tested in out test process 

#### 2.3 Test design
- Functional test cases will be created in Jira 
- GUI test cases will be created in Jira 
- API test case will be created in Postman 
- Queries in DB will be done in MySQL


#### 2.4 Test implementation
- Test cases were added to the cycle summary 
- Postman collection with the API methods was created 
- Authorization token was created accessing the API and it is valid 


#### 2.5 Test execution
- Test cases are executed on the created cycle summary 
- Bugs have been created based on the failed test cases. The complete bug reports can be found here: *se poate pune link catre un fisier cu bug reports in Github 
- API tests are executed based on the checklist (requirements)
- Full regression pack is executed after changes made to the application

  
#### 2.6 Test closure
- All exit criteria were met as mentioned in the Test Planning section (2.1)
- The traceability matrix was generated to demonstrate the business requirements coverage
- Test execution chart was generated, the final report shows a number of 3 failed test cases of a total 30
- There are still 3 opened defects but they have low priority
#### 2.7 Test monitoring and control
Various periodic reports were generated to reflect the current status of the testing process, in case of major problems control measures could be taken.
